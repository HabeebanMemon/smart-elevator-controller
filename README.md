# smart-elevator-controller
Developed a digital elevator controller for 5 floors (0–4) utilizing a Moore Finite State Machine to manage movement, door operations, and idle states. The system optimizes efficiency by implementing a Manhattan distance-based nearest-request algorithm and ensures safety through dedicated timer-controlled door dwell times. Verified through comprehensive behavioral simulation and testbench scenarios.
